easyxfer
========

Small (heh, it's go) program to transfer a file from one host to another reasonably easily and securely.

Nearly totally untested (so far), poorly documented (try `./easyxfer -h`), and likely buggy.  Feel free to try it.

Install with:
```
go get github.com/kd5pbo/easyxfer
```

Please don't look at the source, unless you're teaching and want an antipattern
(or want to learn how to get job security).
